### Category-Management-System

### Step 1: Low-Level Design (LLD)
## Core Functionality
- # 1. CRUD Operations:
 - Create categories at any level (root or nested).
 - Update category names and relationships.
 - Delete a category and all its child categories.
- # 2. Tree View Representation:
 - Query the categories in a hierarchical format.
## Logical Flow
 - 1. Store categories in a tree-like structure using a parent-child relationship in MongoDB.
 - 2. Use a RESTful API architecture for backend services.
 - 3. Ensure efficient handling of nested categories.
